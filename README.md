Solution using map



/* Have the function StringChallenge (str) read the str parameter being passed which will contain the written out version of the numbers 0-9 and the words "minus" or "plus" and convert the expression into an actual final number written out as well. For example: if str is "foursixminustwotwop zero" then this converts to "46-22 +10" which evaluates to 34 and your program should return the final string threefour. If your final answer is negative it should include the word "negative."

Examples

Input: "onezeropluseight" Output: oneeight

Input: "oneminusoneone" Output: negativeonezero
